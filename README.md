# python_tic_tac_toe
## This is my first project strictly involving python. 

### Technologies used
  - Python
  - Jupyter NoteBooks (web app that can be launched from anaconda distribution platform)
### How to Use
  1) Clone repositofry to your own machine
  2) Open file in Jupyter NoteBooks
  3) Scroll to the bottom of the code and run the last cell (should contain the function call playGame())
  4) Fill the requested inputs to play the game 
  5) If you do not win the game it will continue until you do, if you do win the game will end and ask if you'd like to play again of quit. 
### Issues 
  I personally didn't have a ton of issue with logic. My main problem was adjusting to a new programming langauge. One may be able to see from my github that most     of my work has been done in Javascript. I'm looking to grow my skillset a bit and decided to challenege myself with python. 
  I do hope to come back to this mini project as I improve my familiarity with the laguage as I am certain there are points where I can streamline the code.
